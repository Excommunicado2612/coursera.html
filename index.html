<h2>With the evolution of the international laws in the last 100 years,concept of unristricted sovereignty has weakened </h2>
<p>The human rights situation in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) following the dilution of Article 370 and the passage of the <i>Citizenship
 (Amendment) Act (CAA) </i>have brought renewed international focus on India’s human rights practice. Responding to criticism made by 
 the United Nations agencies and others, the Indian state asserted that both J&K and CAA are entirely internal matters and there 
 cannot be any interference in such sovereign decisions.

  &nbsp &nbsp &nbspWhat is remarkable about modern international human rights law is its recognition of individuals as subjects. Classic international 
 law governed the conduct between states and did not recognise the rights of individuals. Countries made agreements on the premise that
 a sovereign state had the exclusive right to take any action it thought fit to deal with its nationals. Such a notion of absolute sovereignty
 was challenged in 19<sup>th</sup> century with the emergence of humanitarian intervention to protect minorities living in other states. Later, in 1919,
 the evolution of labour standards led to the establishment of the International Labour Office (ILO). In 1926, the Slavery Convention adopted 
 by the League of Nations prohibiting slave trade heralded the first human rights treaty based on the principle of dignity of a human being. 
 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted in 1948 by the United Nations, was the first comprehensive international human rights document.
 The Universal Declaration has acquired the force of law as part of the customary law of nations. It has provided the basis for binding human 
 rights treaties and non-binding guidelines/principles that constitute a distinct body of law known as international human rights law.

<h3>Unstainable claim</h3>
<p>This progress of international law in the last 100 years makes the Indian state’s assertion of its sovereign right unsustainable.
 The evolution of international human rights law is also about the gradual weakening of the concept of unrestricted sovereignty.
 The Indian government has ratified several international human rights treaties and submits periodic reports to the respective treaty bodies. 
 By doing so, it has acknowledged the principle that the treatment of its citizens is not entirely an internal matter, and such measures do not enjoy an absolute sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Weakening of the civil society</h3>
<p>While responding to criticism against its human rights practices, the Indian government also refers to the role of free media and
 civil society in protecting the human rights of vulnerable groups. However, in the context of J&K and the ongoing struggle against 
 the CAA, the media has not come out any better. As for civil society organisations, the government since 2014 has systematically targeted 
 them, including by making it difficult for them to receive funds from foreign donors. Since 2014, the government has cancelled the registration
 of about 14,000 NGOs under the <b>Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA)</b>. It has also mainly targeted its own critics.</p>
